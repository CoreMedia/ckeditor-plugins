# Styleguide

While the code-style is mostly controlled by [ESLint][], there are some
exceptions, which are not controlled by the linter. This purpose of this
styleguide is to provide some consistent appearance of the code, so that
you can get used to the patterns while reading it.

> The styleguide is open for discussion.

The styleguide splits into several parts:

* [Styleguide Markdown][]
* [Styleguide TypeScript][]

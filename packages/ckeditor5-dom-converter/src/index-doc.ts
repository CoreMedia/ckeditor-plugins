/**
 * This module is meant as support for developing custom data-processors for
 * CKEditor 5. Its task is converting the data view to corresponding data,
 * assuming that the data view is provided as HTML source as it is by default
 * in CKEditor 5.
 *
 * The overall concept is inspired by the `DOMConverter` as it is available in
 * CKEditor 5 for upcast and downcast between model and view layers.

CKEditor 5 Blocklist is a plugin which retrieves a list of words from a 
CoreMedia Studio service, that are highlighted in the editor's content.
Blocklist entries can be added or removed via a contextual balloon.

The intention behind this plugin is to give editors a possibility to easily
identify inappropriate words, used in any kind of content (user comments in
social media components, for example).

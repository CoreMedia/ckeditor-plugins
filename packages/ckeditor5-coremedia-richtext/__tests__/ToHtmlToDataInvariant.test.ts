/*
 * This is a special set of tests which tests for invariant mapping of CoreMedia
 * RichText 1.0 to HTML and back. It is required, that any valid CoreMedia
 * RichText read from server has a consistent structure when being processed
 * via toData â†’ toHtml.
 *
 * If during this mapping, the structure changes in any way, it will cause the
 * document to be automatically checked out just when opening in CoreMedia
 * Studio for example. The task is to prevent this.
 *
 * This test is meant to be extended on any support case, where such behavior
 * has been observed.

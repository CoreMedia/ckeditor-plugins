# CKEditor 5: DataProcessor Support

> âš  **Deprecated Since v11**
>
> This package is deprecated, as it was dedicated to a similar data-processing
> as it was available within CKEditor 4, without ever reaching a state of
> being a complete replacement.
>
> Instead, the new data-processing architecture relies on pure DOM
> manipulation, providing a much richer API to deal with nodes, elements and
> attributes.

[![API Documentation][badge:docs:api]][api:ckeditor-plugins]

In CKEditor 4 a central part of the mapping architecture were HTML filters and
data filters
(see
[Class HtmlDataProcessor (CKEDITOR.htmlDataProcessor)](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_htmlDataProcessor.html)
and especially
[Class Filter (CKEDITOR.htmlParser.filter)](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_htmlParser_filter.html)).

CKEditor 5 does not come with such filters.

This module re-introduces such filter approaches. It is not meant to be a
replacement but an alternative to the previous filtering mechanisms, which
should ease migration from CKEditor 4 based data processing approaches.

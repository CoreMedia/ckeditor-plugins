/**
 * LinkCommand has a special handling when inserting links with a collapsed
 * (not expanded) selection (aka: no selection). We need to take care of this
 * behavior, which is, that LinkCommand inserts the `linkHref` attribute as
 * text within the editor and afterwards places the cursor after the link.
 *
 * For content-links this is no valid approach. We don't want `content:123`
 * to be written into the CKEditor text field. We want the content's name
 * to be written (and, perhaps, if not available because of concurrent changes,
 * fallback to the `content:123` form.
 *
 * **Approach:** While several approaches exist, the given approach ensures
 * that only one Undo-step is created when (instead of one for the raw
 * content-ID and the content-name afterwards) and that it does not require
 * deep integration into the private API of CKEditor's link feature.
 *
 * Thus, this hook is provided as post-fixer registered at the document.
 * To replace content names, it requires to be informed by the `FormView`
 * of a content name to replace. This is, because content names can only
 * be retrieved asynchronously, while a post-fixer needs to evaluate
 * synchronously.
 *
 * The suggest approach is, that the _Save_ button is disabled until the
 * `FormView` has a valid name to hand over to this plugin, which will then
 * use this name for replacement.
 *
 * **Usage Example:**
 *
 * ```
 * const plugin = <ContentLinkCommandHook | undefined>editor.plugins.get(ContentLinkCommandHook.pluginName);
 * plugin?.registerContentName("content/123", "myName");
 * ```
 *
 * If `registerContentName` is called multiple times, only the last registered
 * replacement will be considered.
 *
 * **Important:** The name must be registered, before `LinkCommand` is executed.
 *
 * **No need to check if replacement required on registration:**
 * It is this plugin which decides, if a replacement is required or not. More
 * specifically, it will only respond to content insertion events (via
 * document.differ) and not to attribute changes. I.e. with the current
 * implementation of `LinkCommand` (as of CKEditor 29.x) it will be triggered
 * if the `LinkCommands` calls `insertContent` for a collapsed selection outside
 * of an existing link â€“ which again triggers the `linkHref` attribute to be
 * written to the text, which is the scenario, we want to prevent for
 * content-links.

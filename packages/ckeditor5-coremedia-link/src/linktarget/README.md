# Link-Target Feature

[![API Documentation][badge:docs:api]][api:ckeditor-plugins]

The Link-Target Plugin extends [CKEditor's Link Feature][cke5:docs:link:feature]
by selection of a `target` attribute for an existing link. It is stored in model
as `linkTarget` attribute.

A document post-fixer exists, so that `linkTarget` attribute cannot exist
without `linkHref` attribute set. This ensures smooth integration into
CKEditor's link feature, as buttons for target selection will be added to
the `LinkActionsView` of CKEditor's link feature.

## Integration

[Integration]: <#integration>

| [Top][] | [Integration][] | [Configuration][] | [RichText][] |

```typescript
import LinkTarget from "@coremedia/ckeditor5-coremedia-link/linktarget/LinkTarget";

ClassicEditor
  .create(document.querySelector("#editor"), {
    plugins: {
      // ...
      LinkTarget,
    },
    // ...
    link: {
      targets: [
        // ...
      ],
      defaultTargets: [
        // ...
      ]
    }
  })
  .then(...)
  .catch(...);
```

## Configuration

[Configuration]: <#configuration>

| [Top][] | [Integration][] | [Configuration][] | [RichText][] |

The plugin can be configured as part of CKEditor's Link Feature configuration.

* [Default Configuration][]
* [Advanced Configuration][]

### Default Configuration

[Default Configuration]: <#default-configuration>

| [Top][] | [Up][Configuration] | [Default Configuration][] | [Advanced Configuration][] | [Default-Target Configuration][] |

The following example shows the default configuration, which is applied, if no
configuration is given:

```typescript
ClassicEditor
  .create(document.querySelector("#editor"), {
    // ...
    link: {
      targets: [
        "_self",
        "_blank",
        "_embed",
        "_other",
      ],
    }
  })
  .then(...)
  .catch(...);
```

It will create buttons in the `LinkActionsView` of CKEditor's Link Feature in
the order as given in the array:

| Target   | Label                 |
|----------|-----------------------|
| `_self`  | _Open in Current Tab_ |
| `_blank` | _Open in New Tab_     |
| `_embed` | _Show Embedded_       |
| `_other` | _Open in Frame_       |

The buttons will be added just in front of the _Unlink_ button.

For customization, you may skip or reorder the targets according to your needs.

#### Predefined: _self

[_self]: <#predefined-_self>

[self]: <#predefined-_self>

| [Top][] | [Up][Default Configuration] | [_self][] | [_blank][] | [_embed][] | [_other][] |

This is the default state for unset `linkTarget` attribute in model. When
pressed, an explicit `linkTarget="_self"` will be applied to the model.

**Recommended:** If you skip this option, you may find none of the option
buttons being active for a newly created link, as new links will not be created
having a `linkTarget` attribute set.

#### Predefined: _blank

[_blank]: <#predefined-_blank>

[blank]: <#predefined-_blank>

| [Top][] | [Up][Default Configuration] | [_self][] | [_blank][] | [_embed][] | [_other][] |

This is the same as the standard HTML attribute value `_blank`.

#### Predefined: _embed

[_embed]: <#predefined-_embed>

[embed]: <#predefined-_embed>

| [Top][] | [Up][Default Configuration] | [_self][] | [_blank][] | [_embed][] | [_other][] |

This is an artificial target derived from `xlink:show="embed"` (and used by
CoreMedia RichText 1.0 for example, see [below][RichText]). It is represented
similar to the standard target names with an underscore as prefix.

#### Predefined: _other

[_other]: <#predefined-_other>

[other]: <#predefined-_other>

| [Top][] | [Up][Default Configuration] | [_self][] | [_blank][] | [_embed][] | [_other][] |

The name corresponds to `xlink:show="other"`. It represents any other value
of `linkTarget` which is not known by any of the other configured targets. If
pressed, an editor will pop up to specify any custom value for
`linkTarget` such as `my-named-frame`.

**Recommended:** It is strongly recommended adding at least `_other` to your
configuration, as it serves as fallback for any otherwise unknown value of
`linkTarget`. Thus, if your model includes `linkTarget="_self"` without `_self`
being part of your configuration, this option will become active and provide an
editor containing `_self` as text.

##### Corner Cases for _other

`_other` is most likely the most flexible state, as it serves as fallback for
any unknown value of `target` and yet must be able to understand any possible
mapping from `xlink:show` and `xlink:role` as required for CoreMedia RichText
1.0 (see [below][RichText]). Thus, there are some corner cases to respect:

* **Special Value `_other`:**

  If the model states `linkTarget="_other"` it is defined to represent
  `xlink:show="other"` without recommended, but not enforced attribute
  `xlink:role`.

  The UI, in this state, will mark _Open in Frame_ as active, while the
  corresponding FormView for editing the target will show an empty editor.

* **Press _Save_ on empty editor:**

  We decided, that the editor wants to signal not to set any target. Thus, if
  editors select `_other` and save with empty text, `linkTarget` attribute will
  be removed. As no `linkTarget` defaults to _Open in Current Tab_, the UI will
  toggle to the corresponding button and turn it on.

  Note, that this will also cause, that if the model value was `_other` as
  stated above, you open the target editor and save, then `_other` will be
  removed from as target.

* **Handle unregistered standard-target such as `_blank`:**

  If the standard-target has not been registered, but is written into the model,
  the `_other` state becomes active. Opening the editor will show
  `_blank` within its input field, just as any other custom target attribute
  value.

* **Manually enter registered standard-target such as `_blank`:**

  If `_blank` is registered as standard-target, a (more or less) hidden feature
  kicks in: When editors write `_blank` into the input field, the value will be
  written directly to model. As a result, after _Save_, not the _Open in Frame_
  button becomes active, but the _Open in New Tab_.

  Having this, editors may decide to manually type any standard-target instead
  of clicking toggle-buttons in the UI.

* **Manually enter `_other`:**

  Similar to the previous approach for `_blank`, the value `_other` will be
  directly written into the model. As a result, next time you open the editor,
  it will show an empty text field (see specification above). In the model you
  will find `linkTarget="_other"` and on data-processing it will be transformed
  to `xlink:show="other"` without `xlink:role` attribute for CoreMedia RichText
  1.0.

* **Raw mode for unexpected values such as `_blank_someRole`:**

  As can be seen in details on data-processing [below][RichText], some
  artificial, unexpected states of `xlink:show` and `xlink:role` attributes may
  result in similar artificial values for `linkTarget`.

  **The general contract for `_other` states, that it becomes active for any
  other unknown value.**

  The same applies to artificial values of `linkTarget` such as
  `_blank_someRole`, which is the resulting mapping for
  `xlink:show="new" xlink:role="someRole"`. Thus, instead of the button _Open in
  New Tab_ becoming active, the `_other` button will become active. Once editors
  click to editor the target, they will see
  `_blank_someRole` as raw text within the input field.

  The same applies to a value `linkTarget="_other_someThing"`, which will
  **not** be understood as `xlink:show="other" xlink:role="someThing"` but
  instead `xlink:show="other" xlink:role="_other_someThing"`. I.e., on _Save_
  it will be directly written as `linkTarget="_other_someThing"` into the model.

### Advanced Configuration

[Advanced Configuration]: <#advanced-configuration>

| [Top][] | [Up][Configuration] | [Default Configuration][] | [Advanced Configuration][] | [Default-Target Configuration][] |

You may add any custom button for predefined `linkTarget` values. For example to
support standard HTML option values `_top` and `_parent` you may add them to the
configuration just as all other options:

```typescript
ClassicEditor
  .create(document.querySelector("#editor"), {
    // ...
    link: {
      targets: [
        "_parent",
        "_top",
        "_other",
      ],
    }
  })
  .then(...)
  .catch(...);
```

Note, that, as no icons are configured for these targets, the button labels will
just contain the plain text value.

You may configure custom icons by adding SVGs or referencing SVGs:

```typescript
import parentIcon from 'path/to/parentIcon.svg';

ClassicEditor
  .create(document.querySelector("#editor"), {
    // ...
    link: {
      targets: [
        {
          name: "_parent",
          icon: parentIcon,
        },
        {
          name: "_top",
          icon: "<svg ...>...</svg>",
          title: "Open at topmost browsing context"
        },
        "_other",
      ],
    }
  })
  .then(...)
  .catch(...);
```

**title:** As can be seen in the example, you may also provide a text for the
tooltip. The text is handed over to `Locale.t()` for translation, so that you
may provide labels translated to your UI language. Translations must be provided 
by using the function `translation-service.add()`. For more information regarding 
`translation-service.add()` consult the CKEditor 5 documentation.

The title defaults to the name of the target option if unset.

**icon:** Icons will be scaled to 20Ã—20. Thus, it is recommended providing SVGs
having this initial size.

### Default-Target Configuration

[Default-Target Configuration]: <#default-target-configuration>

| [Top][] | [Up][Configuration] | [Default Configuration][] | [Advanced Configuration][] | [Default-Target Configuration][] |

You can add defaults for link targets. These ```defaultTargets``` define how a 
link is opened, based on the ```type``` of the link. The config for these targets
distinguishes between content links and external links, where content links are
all links to contents in CoreMedia Studio and external links are links, prefixed
with ```https://```.

```typescript
ClassicEditor
  .create(document.querySelector("#editor"), {
    // ...
    link: {
      defaultTargets: [
        {
          type: "externalLink",
          target: "_blank"
        }
      ],
    }
  })
  .then(...)
  .catch(...);
```

Please note, that you can also set a ```filter``` property instead of a ```type```
to specify additional default targets:

```typescript
ClassicEditor
  .create(document.querySelector("#editor"), {
    // ...
    link: {
      defaultTargets: [
        {
          filter: (url: string) => (url ? url.startsWith("http://") : false),
          target: "_embed"
        }
      ],
    }
  })
  .then(...)
  .catch(...);
```

It's important to know that the order of default targets is relevant. For each
link, all target rules will be applied in the exact order, determined by the config.
If there are multiple matching types or filters, the last one will always be applied.

## CoreMedia RichText 1.0 Integration

[CoreMedia RichText 1.0 Integration]: <#coremedia-richtext-10-integration>

[RichText]: <#coremedia-richtext-10-integration>

| [Top][] | [Integration][] | [Configuration][] | [RichText][] |

The following is not part of the `LinkTarget` plugin, but included in the
CoreMedia RichText plugin. Having this, it is perfectly fine, if you do not
include the `LinkTarget` plugin, but use for example CKEditor's decorator
approach instead, as it will be automatically recognized by the RichText plugin.

CoreMedia RichText 1.0 does not know about the `target` attribute. General
contract is, to model it with [XLink Attribute][w3:xlink] `xlink:show` and
`xlink:role`.

While in the original specification `xlink:role` is meant to hold only
[Legacy extended IRIs][w3:IRI] as values, it is used within CoreMedia CMS to
store any non-predefined target value, such as the name of a frame.

The general contract for mapping `target` attributes during RichText
data-processing is as follows:

| `xlink:show` | `xlink:role` | `target`    |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| `new`        |              | `_blank`    |
| `replace`    |              | `_self`     |
| `embed`      |              | `_embed`    |
| `none`       |              | `_none`     |
| `other`      | `frameName`  | `frameName` |

Targets for `embed` and `none` are _artificial_ mappings, as if they were
defined as standard attribute values for the `target` attribute. This is
required, as the `target` attribute does not provide any alternative to these
states of `xlink:show`.

**_none:** Note, that `_none` is not one of the default targets provided by
`LinkTarget` plugin. If you want to support it, you may add it as part of
the [Advanced Configuration][].

For other well-known values regarding the `target` attribute, these will be
mapped with `xlink:show="other"`:

| `xlink:show` | `xlink:role` | `target`  |
|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| `other`      | `_parent`    | `_parent` |
| `other`      | `_top`       | `_top`    |

Mappings in data processing should ensure, that more artificial states
(from CoreMedia CMS) perspective are also represented meaningfully.

A general recommendation is providing artificial targets for `xlink:show`
states, which are not expected to have a value in `xlink:role`. For example if
the CMS provides `xlink:show="replace" xlink:role="frameName"` it may be
represented as `_self_frameName`, where `_self` is the default mapping for
`replace`.

The following artificial states may occur:

| `xlink:show` | `xlink:role` | `target`           |
|--------------|--------------|--------------------|
| `new`        | `frameName`  | `_blank_frameName` |
| `replace`    | `frameName`  | `_self_frameName`  |
| `embed`      | `frameName`  | `_embed_frameName` |
| `none`       | `frameName`  | `_none_frameName`  |
| `other`      |              | `_other`           |
|              | `frameName`  | `_role_frameName`  |

Without further configuration, `LinkTarget` plugin will assume the values to be
custom targets just as any other unmatched string. Just as for `_none` you may
decide to provide an [Advanced Configuration][] for these combined targets.

### CKEditor 4 Behavior

[CKEditor 4 Behavior]: <#ckeditor-4-behavior>

[CKEditor 4]: <#ckeditor-4-behavior>

| [Top][] | [Up][RichText] | [CKEditor 4][] |

Some details on the CKEditor 4 integration in CoreMedia Studio and its behavior
regarding different states of `xlink:show` and `xlink:role` are shown here. It
is important to note, that for CKEditor 4 we kept `xlink:show` and
`xlink:role` as extra _hidden_ attributes within CKEditor HTML and all actions
modifying these behaviors, knew about them.

For CKEditor 5 we decided to stick to the more generic `target` attribute as
representation within CKEditor. This makes it obsolete adding some special paste
handler transforming such target attributes for example on copy and paste from
external sources.

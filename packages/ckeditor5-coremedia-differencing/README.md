CoreMedia Differencing Plugin
================================================================================

Other than possibly suggested by the plugin-name, this plugin does not take
care of calculating differences by itself. It is meant to be ensure, that
differencing data as generated in CoreMedia Studio are forwarded to editing
view, so that CSS rules can be applied to it, to highlight changes, additions
and deletions.

CoreMedia Server-Side Differencing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In CoreMedia Studio, differences of CoreMedia RichText are evaluated on the
server. The corresponding response is similar to this:

```xml
<div xmlns="http://www.coremedia.com/2003/richtext-1.0"
     xmlns:xdiff="http://www.coremedia.com/2015/xdiff">
  <p>
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
    <strong class="color--red background-color--purple">
      <xdiff:span
              xdiff:class="diff-html-changed"
              xdiff:changes="&lt;b&gt;Strong&lt;/b&gt; style added with class color--red background-color--purple."
              xdiff:id="changed-diff-0">
        consectetuer
      </xdiff:span>
    </strong> adipiscing elit.</p>
</div>
```

The (yet) only relevant attributes used from server-side differencing are
`xdiff:class` applied to `xdiff:span` and `xdiff:changetype` applied to
image elements.

`xdiff:class` may have one of these values:

* **`diff-html-added`**

  Some elements (including text nodes) have been added.

* **`diff-html-changed`**

  Elements, text or element attributes have been changed.

* **`diff-html-removed`**

  Elements, text or element attributes have been removed.

* **`diff-html-conflict`**

  Difference could not be evaluated due to a conflicting change.


`xdiff:changetype` is used for images and its value may be one of these:

* **`diff-removed-image`**
* **`diff-added-image`**
* **`diff-conflict-image`**

The (yet) ignored attributes (but forwarded to editing view) are:

* `xdiff:id` could be used to jump between differences. It is unused yet.

* `xdiff:changes` contains a verbose (English only) description of the applied
changes. As we do not (yet) show these in UI, these are ignored.

* `xdiff:next` and `xdiff:previous`, which is meant to provide some navigation
  feature between the different differencing nodes. It contains references to
  the corresponding IDs.

CSS Styling
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### xdiff:span

As `xdiff:span` is forwarded to editing view, it may be used for highlighting
changes, as for example:

```css
xdiff\:span[xdiff\:class="diff-html-added"] {
  color: rgba(92, 160, 63, 1);
  text-decoration: underline;
}
p > xdiff\:span[xdiff\:class="diff-html-added"]:empty::before {
  /* Some symbol to represent a new-line character. */
  content: 'â†©';
  height: 16px;
  position: absolute;
  margin-left: 3px;
}
xdiff\:span[xdiff\:class="diff-html-removed"] {
  color: rgba(196, 19, 19, 1);
  text-decoration: line-through;
}
xdiff\:span[xdiff\:class="diff-html-changed"] {
  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1);
  background-color: rgba(92, 160, 63, 1);
}
xdiff\:span[xdiff\:class="diff-html-conflict"] {
  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1);
  background-color: rgba(196, 19, 19, 1);
}
xdiff\:span[xdiff\:class="diff-html-changed"] img {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  outline: 4px dashed rgba(92, 160, 63, 1);
  outline-offset: -4px;
}
```

### img and xdiff:changetype

If applying rules to `<img>` elements, it is important to understand, that
CKEditor adds the corresponding `xdiff:changetype` to the surrounding element
of the image. For `ImageInline` plugin, this is some `<span>` having class
attribute `image-inline`, for images kept via General HTML Support (GHS), it
is a `<span>` with class attribute `html-object-embed`.

To support CKEditor with or without image plugin and possible fallback to
GHS, corresponding CSS rules may look like this:

```css
span.image-inline[xdiff\:changetype="diff-added-image"],
span.html-object-embed[xdiff\:changetype="diff-added-image"] {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  outline: 2px solid rgba(92, 160, 63, 1) !important;
  outline-offset: -2px;
}
span.image-inline[xdiff\:changetype="diff-removed-image"],
span.html-object-embed[xdiff\:changetype="diff-removed-image"] {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  outline: 2px solid rgba(196, 19, 19, 1) !important;
  outline-offset: -2px;
}
span.image-inline[xdiff\:changetype="diff-conflict-image"],
span.html-object-embed[xdiff\:changetype="diff-conflict-image"] {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  outline: 4px dashed rgba(196, 19, 19, 1) !important;
  outline-offset: -4px;
}
```

### Added Newlines

Styling added newlines is a little tricky. This is, because in editing view
such added newlines will look like this:

```xml
<p>
  Lorem ipsum&nbsp;
  <xdiff:span xdiff:class="diff-html-added" xdiff:id="added-diff-0">
    <br data-cke-filler="true">
  </xdiff:span>
</p>
```

Thus, you have to find a CSS selector, which applies to an `<xdiff:span>` within
a paragraph `<p>`, which only contains a `<br>` element.

As there is no _has-child_ selector in CSS, the only way is to style the
corresponding `<br>` tag, which again has some limitations regarding styling.
Kudos to a posting at [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/899252/can-you-target-br-with-css),
there is some trick though, to style such added newlines. Here is an example:

```css
p > xdiff\:span[xdiff\:class="diff-html-added"] > br[data-cke-filler="true"]:only-child {
  display: block;
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 16px;
  height: 16px;
  width: 16px;
  background-image: url("data:image/svg+xml;base64,PD94bWwgdmVyc2lvbj0iMS4wIiBlbmNvZGluZz0idXRmLTgiPz4KPHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciCiAgICAgeD0iMHB4IgogICAgIHk9IjBweCIKICAgICB3aWR0aD0iMTZweCIKICAgICBoZWlnaHQ9IjE2cHgiCiAgICAgdmlld0JveD0iMCAwIDE2IDE2Ij4KPHBvbHlnb24gZmlsbD0icmdiKDkyLCAxNjAsIDYzKSIgcG9pbnRzPSIxMSw0IDExLDYgMTMsNiAxMyw5IDUsOSA1LDYgMSwxMCA1LDE0IDUsMTEgMTUsMTEgMTUsOSAxNSw2IDE1LDQiLz4KPC9zdmc+Cg==");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: top left;
  background-origin: content-box;
  content: "";
  position: relative;
}
```

Assumptions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* A CKEditor showing differences is always in read-only mode.

* Any other attribute than `xdiff:class` are irrelevant. For a set of all
  allowed attributes, see [xdiff.xsd][].

Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Differences must never be written back to server.

* Copying from differencing data to a standard CKEditor should strip the
  `xdiff:span` elements. This is most likely triggered by CKEditor itself,
  as for standard editors, the element `xdiff:span` should be unknown.

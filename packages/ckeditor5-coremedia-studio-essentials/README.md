**Module:** `@coremedia/ckeditor5-coremedia-studio-essentials`

Provides a plugin for CKEditor 5 which consolidates the essential plugins for
CoreMedia Studio. The plugins, provided by this package, are crucial to make
CKEditor 5 work in CoreMedia Studio without corrupting any data.

There are, however, other useful plugins to enable CoreMedia features in
CKEditor 5, that are not part of this package. Those plugins are not mandatory,
but recommended to use in any CoreMedia Studio CKEditor 5 build. Please have a
look at the corresponding repository or the documentation to learn more about
other provided plugins.

Plugins contained:

* `CoreMediaRichText` from [`@coremedia/ckeditor5-richtext`](../ckeditor5-coremedia-richtext)

  This plugin ensures, that any CoreMedia RichText 1.0 data are transformed to
  some HTML (in Data View of CKEditor) which can be edited within CKEditor.

* `CoreMediaRichTextSupport` from [`@coremedia/ckeditor5-richtext-support`](../ckeditor5-coremedia-richtext-support)

  This plugin, based on CKEditor's General HTML Support (GHS) ensures, that
  CKEditor's defensive strategy _remove elements and attributes I do not know
  how to edit_ to not remove structures generated by `CoreMediaRichText` plugin.

Simply speaking, having both plugins, you do not risk losing elements or
attributes, which are stored as CoreMedia RichText 1.0 on CMS server, just
by loading it into a CKEditor only containing the essential plugins above.

**Source Code Editing Plugin recommended:** As, having only these essential
plugins, many elements and attributes cannot be edited, we strongly recommend
adding CKEditor's Source Code Editing Plugin, if you did not add any other
plugins.

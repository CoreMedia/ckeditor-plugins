# CKEditor 5 Evaluation and Preparation

This repository contains the results of our preparation steps for
replacing CKEditor 4 which reaches EOL soon. While `archive/` contains
previous evaluation efforts, the root-folder represents the current
evaluation process.

## Command Line Reference

### Install Dependencies

```
yarn bootstrap
```

### Build Artifacts

```
yarn build
```

You will find an editor, which is ready to test in [app/sample](app/sample/index.html).

### Add Dependency

```text
yarn add the-dependency
```

### Add Development Dependency

```text
yarn add the-development-dependency --dev
```

### Troubleshooting

#### SyntaxError on Windows Running yarn test

```text
basedir=$(dirname "$(echo "$0" | sed -e 's,\\,/,g')")
          ^^^^^^^

SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list
```

This seems to be related to:

* [Unable to run tests in development Environment on Windows. ¬∑ Issue #686 ¬∑ ckeditor/ckeditor5](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/686)

Although it looks as if it should be fixed (in 2017) still observing this issue.
Workaround for now: Call tests directly e.g. via:

```
./node_modules/.bin/ckeditor5-dev-tests.cmd --files=symbol-on-paste-mapper
```

## CKEditor Research

### Logging

* CKEditor does not provide any logging facade itself. It uses the Console log
    directly, e.g., via `console.error()` or `console.log()`.
* For CKEditor 4 plugins in CoreMedia Workspace we used a custom class
    `CKEDITOR.coremedia.Logger` to provide logging abilities. This used
    the Console log in the end as well, but provided some abstraction and
    better control, if certain types of logging are enabled or not.
